# sniper-code README

WARNING: NOT READY

this currently is under development. This will likely be under development for a while. I'm going to be working to implement this in another editor first, due to issues getting it to compile for the vscode's electron version, which is different from the system's version

implementation of [sniper snippet manager](https://github.com/Sniper-Core) in vscode,which when fully implemented this will allow you to use the same snippets across editors. it's planned to also have a few features not found in other snippet managers, such as modular,library-based snippets.

## Features

- todo

## Requirements

since sniper is planned to be editor agnostic, you'll have to install sniper-core and sniper-node indepently, I plan on writing an installer further into development. right now, the only reason you should do that is if you want to contribute to the project, because it is nowhere near ready for use.

## Extension Settings

- todo


## Known Issues

- currently can't compile for vscode due to limitations of build tools involved, until that is solved this will likely not be coming to vscode anytime soon.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

- todo, this isn't even release 0.0.1
